### COVID-19â€™s Impact on the U.S. Economy 

We are hoping to create interactive data visualizations which help you better understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on specific components of the U.S. economy such as personal income, consumer spending, and GDP. It would be interesting to compare our three chosen parameters (personal income, consumer spending, and GDP) between states with different responses to the pandemic or varying number of deaths/cases to determine any correlation between COVID-19 response/amount of devastation to economic parameters. The datasets provided by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis will help us create versatile and detailed visualizations. We will also use data from the COVID Tracking Project in order to include the number of cases, deaths, and number of vaccinations per state. We additionally plan on creating an interactive visualization that shows the economic trends within different states in the United States. Lastly, we will make an interactive map of the United States that highlights the relationship between COVID-19 rates and economic growth.
